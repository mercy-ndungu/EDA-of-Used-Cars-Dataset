# Used Cars Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis 
# Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes a dataset containing information on used cars, with the aim of understanding the key factors that influence car prices and characteristics. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploring relationships and distributions between variables.
# Dataset
The dataset contains various features of used cars such as:
Name
Location
Year
Kilometers Driven
Fuel type
Transmission
Owner Type'
Mileage
Engine
Power
Number of seats
New_Price
Price
The data was obtained from Kaggle. LInk(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmanibedi/cars4u).
# Steps Undertaken
1. Data Cleaning
   Handled missing values and duplicates.
   Standardized column names and formats.
   Converted data types where necessary.
2. Feature Engineering
    Extracted new features such as the age of the cars using datetime.
    Categorized numerical and categorical features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
    Visualized distributions of numerical variables.
    Analyzed relationships between key features and the target variable, in this case, which is price.
    Investigated correlations to identify multicollinearity and feature importance.
